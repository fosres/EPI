Strings

We say a phrase is an anagram of another if the letters can be reorganized from one into
another while ignoring spaces. The case of letters are ignored, i.e., whether a letter is capital or lowercase
does not matter. The following figure shows an anagram presented in Harry Potter and the Chamber of
Secrets:

"Tom Marvolo Riddle" --> "I Am Lord Voldemort"

Write the function isAnagram that checks whether two strings are anagrams of each other. Assume the
input strings s1 and s2 only contain letters and spaces. Also assume s1 and s2 are not empty (so their
lengths are at least 1).
Hint. To reiterate, spaces should be ignored.
Hint. To reiterate, whether a letter is capital or lowercase does not matter. So ’A’ and ’a’ should be
treated the same.
Hint. Two strings are anagrams of each other if each letter occurs the same number of times. For
example, in both "Dormitory" and "Dirty Room"
• ’d’ occurs 1 time
• ’i’ occurs 1 time
• ’m’ occurs 1 time
• ’o’ occurs 2 times
• ’r’ occurs 2 times
• ’t’ occurs 1 time
• ’y’ occurs 1 time
• All other letters occur 0 times
