# Programming-Interview-Concepts

This project has hiearchy of:

Paradigm of Language --> Language --> Programming Concept

Look at EPI - Adnan Aziz for Practical Programming

Concepts--and that is just for Imperative

Expect the Lingua Franca Programming Language

for the Paradigm of Programming Language to

contain its own version of EVERY Practical

Programming Concept wherever found in the

other languages of that Paradigm or the

Lingua Franca itself.

So expect all Practical Programming

Concepts for each Paradigm of the

following:

Functional: Haskell

Imperative: C Programming Language

Markup: HTML

Multi-Paradigm: JavaScript
